# The OOMF Writers Guide
## A Guide for Creating Stories in The OOMF Universe

---

## Overview

**The OOMF (Officially Missing Our Future)** is an Afrofuturist cyberpunk narrative universe centered on cultural preservation, resistance against systematic erasure, and the power of Black queer community. This guide provides the foundation for writers creating stories in this world.

---

## Core Concept

The world is being **systematically rewritten**—not with weapons, but through erasure. The OOMF fights back not just with data, but with **culture, energy, and human connection**.

### The Central Conflict
**Erasure vs. Preservation** - A silent war where histories, communities, and futures are deleted by algorithmic control. The OOMF exists to restore what has been lost and protect what remains.

---

## World-Building

### The Signal
**What it is:** The ultimate evolution of unbridled capitalism—an entity that manipulates information flows, restructures public narratives, and deletes histories that don't serve its agenda.

**How it works:**
- Algorithmic barriers and digital voids
- Rewrites past, present, and future
- Consumes entire communities
- Makes erasure feel like "progress" (Urban Renewal 2.0)
- Not a simple villain—an insidious, ever-present force

**Visual language:** Flickering distortions, error codes, dissonant frequencies, cold corporate aesthetics, digital glitches consuming culture

### The Echo
**What it is:** London's last true Black queer sanctuary—now erased but returned through The OOMF's first mission.

**What it represents:** Joy, struggle, resilience, community, cultural memory, safe space, collective history

**Narrative function:** A symbol of what The Signal destroys and what The OOMF fights to preserve

### The Archive
**Location:** Underground data vault beneath the Thames in London, where old city ghosts whisper beneath modern glass towers

**Contains:** Holographic projections of redacted documents, censored media, digital voids where history used to be

**Function:** Base of operations, sanctuary for forbidden knowledge, training ground

### The Nexus Engine
**What it is:** Ancient-meets-futuristic construct at the heart of The Nexus Chamber—a swirling core of light and code

**Function:** Unlocks latent potential suppressed by The Signal, reveals powers already within individuals

**Aesthetic:** Cathedral-like space, glowing data conduits, energy fields, visual spectacle of transformation

## Characters

### Ivor "Cipher" Cummings (The Mentor)
- **Background:** Former high-ranking civil servant who turned against the establishment
- **Role:** Strategist, initiator of The OOMF, guardian of lost histories
- **Personality:** Watchful, knowing, calculated, carries weight of what he's witnessed
- **Key trait:** Sees patterns others miss, understands both the system and resistance

### The OOMF Team Powers

Each member was **already powerful**—The Nexus Engine only revealed what The Signal tried to suppress.

- **Fluxion (The Journalist):** Bends digital time—rewinds, fast-forwards, exposes manipulated realities
- **NovaCode (The Engineer):** Sees corrupted data structure, repairs and rewrites The Signal's distortions in real time
- **Lumina (The Filmmaker):** Body illuminates lost visuals—scenes erased from history play out before her eyes
- **VibraBolt (The Organizer):** Amplifies silenced voices, ensures stories are heard across time and space
- **EchoLink (The Poet/Archivist):** Summons and weaves fragmented oral histories, restores lost narratives
- **RedShift (The Historian):** Sees time as interconnected web, uncovers how past ripples into present
- **SoulCircuit (The Musician):** Curates deep emotional undercurrents of suppressed stories into resonant experiences
- **Streamline (The Digital Artist):** Turns raw data into immersive living experiences
- **Nexus (The Elder):** Binds and connects, ensures knowledge and people are never lost to time

### Creating New Characters

When introducing new OOMF members or allies:
1. **Ground them in real cultural work** (activism, art, community organizing, preservation)
2. **Their power reflects their passion** (what they already do, amplified)
3. **They were chosen because they already fight back** in ways they don't realize
4. **Give them specific cultural stakes** (what erasure has cost them personally)

## Narrative Voice & Tone

### Writing Style
**Poetic yet urgent** - Mix cyberpunk aesthetics with Afrofuturist optimism

**Key characteristics:**
- Vivid sensory details (neon glow, pulsing data, flickering codes)
- Metaphors related to light, sound, data, energy
- Focus on emotional weight of erasure
- Emphasis on community and connection
- Grounded in real UK locations and Black queer cultural spaces

### Vocabulary to Use
- Systematic erasure / algorithmic barriers / rewriting reality / digital voids
- Cultural guardians / silenced voices / fragmented histories / lost narratives
- Neon glow / pulsing data / flickering codes / resonant frequencies
- Underground sanctuaries / encrypted networks / distorted realities
- Collective memory / cultural preservation / resistance breathing

### Avoid
- Generic cyber threats or simple "hacker vs. corporation" plots
- Simple good vs. evil framing (The Signal is systemic, not a person)
- Passive observation (characters must act, resist, create)
- Repetitive action descriptions (vary the language, keep it fresh)
- Oversimplified motivations (root resistance in specific cultural stakes)

---

## Story Structure Framework

### Three-Act Structure (The Origin Model)

**Act 1: The Call**
- Establish the world and The Signal's threat
- Show what's at stake (specific place, community, history)
- Character(s) summoned or drawn to resistance
- Decision point: commitment to the fight

**Act 2: The Awakening/Preparation**
- Training, power discovery, or strategic planning
- Team dynamics and trust building
- The Signal strikes back (complications)
- Decision point: tactical choice under pressure

**Act 3: The Mission**
- Direct action against The Signal's plan
- Use culture, energy, connection (not just data) as weapons
- Climactic confrontation
- Victory with awareness that the fight continues

### Story Themes to Explore

1. **Memory vs. Forgetting** - What happens when history is deleted? Who decides what's remembered?
2. **Individual vs. Collective Power** - How do personal abilities serve community liberation?
3. **Analog vs. Digital** - The irreplaceable value of physical space, oral tradition, embodied culture
4. **Visibility vs. Erasure** - What makes communities "seen" or rendered invisible?
5. **Past vs. Future** - How do we honor history while building something new?
6. **Resistance vs. Compliance** - The cost of fighting back vs. the cost of acceptance

## Visual Aesthetics

### Afrofuturist Cyberpunk Fusion

**Key visual elements:**
- Neon-lit circuitry blended with traditional African patterns
- Gold accents and holographic displays
- Futuristic urban sprawl meets cultural symbols
- Bioluminescence and data streams as living elements
- Recognizable UK architecture (especially London) with digital overlays

### Color Palette
- **The Signal:** Cold blues, sterile whites, corporate grays, glitch artifacts
- **The OOMF:** Warm golds/yellows, vibrant neons, deep blacks, cultural colors
- **The Echo/Victory:** Rainbow spectrum, celebration, warmth, life

### Visual Metaphors
- **Light breaking through darkness** = truth emerging
- **Code rewriting itself** = restoration of history
- **Holographic projections** = memory made visible
- **Glitches and distortions** = The Signal's presence
- **Flowing data streams** = connection and communication

---

## Setting Guidelines

### UK Cities in The OOMF Universe

The OOMF operates across the UK, primarily in cities with significant Black queer communities:

- **London:** The Archive (beneath Thames), The Echo, main base of operations
- **Manchester:** Industrial resistance, music culture stronghold
- **Birmingham:** Community organizing hub
- **Bristol:** Street art and cultural activism
- **Cardiff:** Welsh resistance networks

**Key principle:** Ground futurism in real geography. Use recognizable landmarks with digital/futuristic overlays.

---

## Mission Types

### 1. Cultural Preservation Missions
**Goal:** Protect or restore spaces, traditions, or histories from erasure
**Examples:** Saving a sanctuary, recovering deleted archives, broadcasting suppressed stories

### 2. Counter-Narrative Missions
**Goal:** Combat misinformation or expose hidden truths
**Examples:** Hijacking media infrastructure, viral truth campaigns, data vault infiltration

### 3. Community Defense Missions
**Goal:** Protect people from The Signal's targeting
**Examples:** Evacuating vulnerable communities, creating safe networks, blocking surveillance

### 4. Offensive Strikes
**Goal:** Directly sabotage The Signal's operations
**Examples:** Shutting down Urban Renewal 2.0 projects, corrupting erasure algorithms, exposing corporate backers

---

## Writing Dialogue

### Cipher's Voice
- Measured, strategic, carries historical weight
- Uses metaphors about time, memory, visibility
- "The Signal is everywhere, but so are we."
- "You were chosen because you already fight back in ways you don't realize."

### The OOMF Team
- Authentic, varied voices reflecting different backgrounds
- Mix technical language with cultural references
- Show camaraderie, trust, shared purpose
- Let abilities inform speech (Fluxion talks about time, VibraBolt about amplification)

### The Signal
- When "speaking" (error messages, corporate statements, algorithm outputs)
- Cold, euphemistic, sanitized language
- "Urban Renewal" / "Optimization" / "Streamlining" / "Progress"
- Makes erasure sound inevitable and beneficial

---

## Connecting to Real-World Mission

**CRITICAL:** Every OOMF story must bridge to BLKOUT UK's real mission.

**Explicit connections:**
- "We need more voices to build the future"
- "Co-produce your own history"
- "The fight continues in your world"
- References to real community archiving, storytelling, cultural preservation

**The OOMF is not just entertainment**—it's a call to action for readers to:
- Preserve their own communities' histories
- Resist systematic erasure in real life
- Connect with others fighting similar battles
- Become cultural guardians themselves

## FAQ for Writers

**Q: Can The OOMF lose?**
A: They can face setbacks, but ultimate erasure should never feel inevitable. The story is about resistance that breathes, not hopeless defeat.

**Q: Can new characters have different types of powers?**
A: Yes! Powers should reflect what characters are passionate about. A chef might "restore lost recipes," a dancer might "preserve movement traditions."

**Q: Does every story need to be in the UK?**
A: The Archive is in London, but The Signal is global. Stories can feature international operations or connected resistance movements.

**Q: Can we show The Signal winning sometimes?**
A: Yes, to raise stakes. But never without showing the cost and the continued resistance. Erasure may happen, but it's never accepted as final.

**Q: How do we handle real-world references?**
A: Ground the futurism in real issues: gentrification, digital surveillance, cultural appropriation, archive destruction. Make it recognizable.

**Q: Can characters die?**
A: Yes, but with purpose. Death should never be gratuitous—it should illustrate the stakes of erasure and inspire continued resistance.

## Final Guidance

**Remember:**
1. The OOMF is about **community**, not individual heroism
2. **Culture is power**—not just data or technology
3. The enemy is **systematic erasure**, not a person to defeat
4. Stories should **inspire real-world action**
5. **Joy and celebration** are as important as struggle
6. The fight is **ongoing**—there is no "final victory"

**The OOMF exists because resistance still breathes.**
