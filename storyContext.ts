export const STORY_CONTEXT = {
  worldBuilding: `The world is not falling apart—it is being systematically rewritten. Beneath the neon glow of corporate billboards, beyond the algorithmic barriers of social feeds, a silent war is being waged. Not with weapons, but with erasure. A force known only as The Signal manipulates information flows, restructures public narratives, and deletes histories that don't serve its agenda. It is the ultimate evolution of unbridled capitalism, built to flatten difference, reduce humans to consumers, and hoard knowledge for the privileged few.`,

  theSignal: `The Signal is the antagonist—an entity that manipulates information flows, restructures public narratives, and deletes histories. It consumes entire communities, rewriting their past, present, and future. It is the ultimate evolution of unbridled capitalism, built to flatten difference and hoard knowledge for the privileged few.`,

  theEcho: `The Echo is London's last true Black queer sanctuary. It has been erased—its digital presence wiped clean, its patrons scattered, and its legacy reduced to an algorithmic afterthought. It represents joy, struggle, resilience, and community that The Signal seeks to destroy.`,

  theArchive: `The Archive is an underground data vault hidden beneath the Thames in London, where the old city's ghosts whisper beneath modern glass towers. It is Cipher's base of operations, filled with holographic projections of redacted documents, censored media, and digital voids where history used to be.`,

  theNexusEngine: `The Nexus Chamber is a cathedral-like space lined with glowing data conduits. At its heart stands The Nexus Engine, an ancient-meets-futuristic construct—a swirling core of light and code, capable of unlocking the latent potential within the recruits, revealing powers that The Signal tried to suppress.`,

  cipher: `Ivor "Cipher" Cummings is a former high-ranking civil servant who turned his back on the establishment after seeing firsthand how The Signal consumed entire communities. He watches from The Archive, initiating The OOMF (Officially Missing Our Future) to fight back against erasure. He is a strategist, mentor, and guardian of lost histories.`,

  teamPowers: {
    fluxion: "A journalist who can bend digital time itself—rewinding, fast-forwarding, and exposing manipulated realities.",
    novaCode: "A security engineer who sees the underlying structure of corrupted data and can repair it—rewriting The Signal's distortions in real time.",
    lumina: "A filmmaker whose body illuminates lost visuals—scenes erased from history, playing out before her eyes.",
    vibraBolt: "A community organizer flooded with unspoken voices—able to amplify silenced stories, ensuring they are heard across time and space."
  },

  resistance: `Resistance still breathes. The OOMF fight back not just with data, but with culture, energy, and human connection. They are activists, hackers, storytellers, and cultural guardians—already attuned to the cracks in The Signal's control.`,

  urbanRenewal: `Urban Renewal 2.0 is The Signal's citywide plan to erase the last vestiges of Black queer nightlife, replacing them with hyper-commercialized, surveillance-heavy entertainment districts. It represents systematic cultural erasure disguised as progress.`,

  themes: `The story explores systematic erasure vs. cultural preservation, algorithmic control vs. human connection, forgotten histories vs. active remembrance, and corporate capitalism vs. community resistance. The fight is not with weapons, but with memory, truth, and cultural power.`
